# auto-infector
This is an auto infector designed for educational purposes, aimed at pentesters and social engineers. The script runs on the victim's PC and downloads all the viruses from a designated folder or file link, then launches them at startup (by adding them to shell:startup). The script runs automatically at startup and re-downloads viruses to update them or add new ones. If the victim (who of course has given you the permission to do that) adds the "pro_cracker" folder to their antivirus exclusions, they will remain infected indefinitely.
